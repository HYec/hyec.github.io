## Persional Webpage

This repository redirects my GitHub pages [hyec.github.io](https://hyec.github.io) and my apex domain [hyec.me](https://hyec.me) to my blog [www.hyec.me](https://www.hyec.me) hosted elsewhere.



## How this works

1. Create [YOUNAME].github.io repository and set CNAME to your www subdomain.
2. Follow [Setting up an apex domain and www subdomain](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain-and-www-subdomain/) by Github to set up you apex domain and www subdomain to GitHub pages.
3. Give it 24 hours to issue the certificates then enable `Enforce HTTPS` .
4. Set up your www subdomain to your host provider.
